            <h1>This website was inspired by the Indian movie "Aparajito". This movie has a completely different translation in China, but it also reflects the meaning of the movie, which probably means "Song of the Great River". Whether in real life or in mythological epics, there are accounts of the disappearance of great rivers and lakes. For example, the Lop Nor. Before 330 A.D., there was more water in the lake, and the city of Loulan in the northwest was the famous "Silk Road" choke point. Of course, the mysterious ancient city of Loulan died together with it; Yunmengze is the general name of a group of ancient lakes on the Jianghan Plain in Hubei Province, China, bounded by the Yangtze River to the south. The circumference of this group of lakes was about 450 kilometers in the early Qin Dynasty. The only remaining large lake today, Dongting Lake, is only 207 km long. Later, due to the sediment deposition brought by the Yangtze River and the Han River, the Han River delta continued to stretch and gradually decreased in extent. During the Wei-Jin-North and South Dynasties, it was reduced by half and disintegrated into a cluster of small lakes during the Tang and Song Dynasties; the Aral Sea, an endorheic saltwater lake located in Central Asia. The Aral Sea used to be one of the largest inland lakes in the world. However, the Aral Sea began to show dramatic and rapid shrinkage into the second half of the 20th century as the Soviets used large amounts of Aral Sea water for agricultural irrigation projects. These are the sources of my creation and the deeper meaning of this website. I chose the mental model to build a Growing or Stretched to build an art website. Due to Jacob's Law, users spend most of their time on other websites, so I created buttons that are similar to the design language in the current software to guide users. It is very natural for users to click on the colorful buttons. This then leads to a page of randomly generated lines, which I call "rivers". Each time you click on the river button, a new line will grow, and the faster you click, the faster the "river" will be created. In addition, if the user clicks on an area other than the button, some of the "rivers" will randomly die out. This page has some decompression function, similar to pressing bubble wrap.In the process of experiencing this page, I believe the user will feel the unique life force of the river and lake. A line seems to emerge from the center as if it has life, just like the human civilization that grows and thrives by the river; at the same time, the death of the river will also take away a piece of human civilization, and I hope that human beings can remember to protect the river we depend on while enjoying the convenience brought by the river. In many civilizations, the important rivers are compared to mothers, so we can have no heroes, but we cannot have no "mothers".</h1>
