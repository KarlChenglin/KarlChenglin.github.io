                <div class="drop-area"> <h1>1.What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h1>
                   </div>
                   <P>When I first opened the page, I didn't know what to do. Then, what I noticed was that there were a lot of green bars standing on the page that I thought could be expanded. So I clicked on one of them, and it expanded into a box and there was this jumping text.</P>

               
                   <div class="drop-area"><h1>2.Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h1></div>
                    <p> 1.Open the seven Poems by Justine Nguy ễ n - Nguy ễ n website.<br> 2.I clicked on each green rectangle like a tree trunk.<br>3.Find the music switch in the upper right corner and turn it on.<br>4.Hover over the block and observe the shadow effect.<br>5.Turn all squares green.<br>6.Click on the top left corner "seven Poems by Justine Nguy ễ n - Nguy ễ n", all of the green squares regression to the green belt.<br>7.Open the knee-flowers button and watch the text pop up with the music.<br>8. End of two minutes</p>
        

                
                    <div class="drop-area"><h1>3.What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h1></div>
                <p>Turn on the knee flower button and watch the text pop up with the music. Follow the rhythm of words and music and feel the poetry.</p>
        
                <div class="drop-area"><h1>4.What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h1></div>
                <p>Click. Observe the hover effect.</p>
        
                <div class="drop-area"><h1>5.What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h1></div>
                <p>I think their goal is to use technology to bring about new poetry reading experiences. The rectangular boxes open like scrolls, and the words jump out one by one, like the poet himself speaking, slowly and gracefully. When people read traditional poetry, they rely on their own imagination of the fantasy scene in the poem, and this website adds a little guidance on the imagination level, plus the collocation of music, smooth animation, bringing a new reading effect.</p>
        
                <div class="drop-area"><h1>6.What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h1></div>
                <p>I think it's a very good way. Now, poetry is being squeezed. Short videos and social media are eating into modern people's time. But we still need poetry, and poetry needs to be integrated into our culture in a different way. I think it's a very gentle way to carry the content of the poem into one's inner world. Readers often just because of curiosity, keep clicking, along with the rhythm of music, gorgeous colors, into the world of poetry.</p>
            
                <div class="drop-area"><h1>7.What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h1></div>
                <p> I feel that the length and number of interactions should continue to increase over time. I also believe that the game should be played in less than a minute, with up to ten interactions. This is a reasonable and effective level.</p>
                
                <div class="drop-area"><h1>8.What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h1></div>
                <p>My impression of an interactive experience is that it's quick and responsive. As time goes on, I think I should slow down the pace and speed of experience so that I can better interact with it. In fact, my interaction with the site was much longer than two minutes, and the experience was much more than that. It can be clicked, fixed you are interested in the word, and when the click will have a corresponding sound effect, similar to a clear and distant drum, with a wonderful reverb. After playing for a while, we can try to read the poem with the frequency that the words pop up, which brings a unique interactive experience.</p>
                
                <div class="drop-area"><h1>9.What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h1></div>
                <p>The rectangular proportions look like references to modern film frames; Clicking on the author's name restores everything to normal, similar to the logic of modern phones, which have a "home" button to return to the original point. Animation effects are close to the popular flat design.</p>
        
                <div class="drop-area"><h1>10.What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it? </h1></div>
                <p>It leads the reader to interactive actions, such as a "home" button on a phone that sets everything to zero, and the user tries to find the button, which is similar in logic to other media in the real world and intuitive. Mimicking the scale of a movie can also focus users' attention so quickly that they can't ignore the pulsating text and enhance interaction.</p>
        
                <div class="drop-area"><h1>11.What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h1></div>
                <p> I promote my feelings and imagination. I imagine the timing of these poems, I imagine the feeling and effect of them appearing in reality, because it's an interaction that's built on reality. This has a much better emotional connection than simply reading lines of poetry. For example, the audience will have a sense of curiosity and be more exploratory, and clicking on chat software will produce more information. Is it the same on this website? It's even more fun to discover that such simple actions can lead to interactions.</p>
        
                <div class="drop-area"><h1>12.What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h1></div>
                <p>The site didn't give me very effective guidance, and my every action was driven by my instinctive curiosity, so it was frustrating to miss out on a lot of designer interactions. I had to keep clicking on every corner of the page to find some interesting interactions designed by the author. For example, the directory bar in the lower right corner of this website was designed. At first, I thought it was a cancel button, which kept me from trying this button, so that I kept interacting with the start page when I first experienced this website.</p>
                
                <div class="drop-area"><h1>13.What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h1></div>
                <p>My favorite elements are movement and color. The movement of the site is very smooth, the interactive animation is very smooth; In addition, each page color is very bold and gorgeous, with low saturation color to achieve a poetic atmosphere, leading the reader to stretch the imagination of the text. The use of music is also very good. The music of each poem is different, but it is close to the rhythm of the poem itself, and at the same time, it is a whole series. Some of the buttons also have an elaborate beep, and overall, it all adds up to a more powerful emotional expression.</p>
